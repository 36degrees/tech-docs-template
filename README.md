# Tech Docs Template

The Tech Docs Template is a [middleman template][mmt] that
you can use to build technical documentation using a GOV.UK style.

This repo is the template used to generate new sites. The generated site uses HTML, CSS, JS and images from the [tech docs gem](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem).

ðŸ‘‰ Find out more about the template and its features from the [Tech Docs Template documentation][tdt-docs].

## Before you start

To use the Tech Docs Template you need:

- [Ruby][install-ruby]
- [Middleman][install-middleman]

## Get started

To create a new project using the Tech Docs Template, run:

```sh
middleman init PROJECT_NAME -T alphagov/tech-docs-template
```

where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your new project.

This command creates a minimal functional website using the Tech Docs Template.

## Preview your website locally

To preview your new website locally, navigate to your project folder and run:

```sh
bundle exec middleman server
```

ðŸ‘‰ See the generated website on `http://localhost:4567` in your browser. Any content changes you make to your website will be updated in real time.

To shut down the Middleman instance running on your machine, use `ctrl+C`

If you make changes to the `config/tech-docs.yml` configuration file, you need to restart Middleman to see the changes.
